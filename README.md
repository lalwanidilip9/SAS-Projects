# Description
This is my work from the statistics course I took during my Graduate course at TAMU. The course involved writing and executing SAS programs under the Windows environment in the context of applied statistics problems. SAS procedures are used to read and analyze various types of data sets as they apply to t-tests, simple and multiple regressions, ANOVA, categorical analysis, and repeated measures.
